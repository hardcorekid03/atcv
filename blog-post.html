										<p align="justify">
											In 2014, I started working as a freelance technician. While I enjoyed my job, I felt limited by the projects I was working on 
											and the rigid schedule I was required to keep. I yearned for more flexibility and creative freedom in my work. 
											I enjoyed the work so much that I began to seek out more freelance projects. 
											I created this website to showcase my portfolio and to gain more clients.
										</p>

											“If you don’t take risks, you can’t create a future.”
											- Monkey D. Luffy
										</blockquote>
										<p align="justify">
											When the pandemic began I had been laid off from my job and was struggling to make ends meet. 
											I had always been passionate about computers and I thought that maybe I could use my knowledge 
											to help others and make some money in the process. So, I decided to take the plunge and open up my 
											own computer repair service. I had saved up enough money to buy the necessary tools and equipment.
										</p>
										<p align="justify">
											At first, business was slow. People were wary of coming out of their homes during the pandemic, so 
											I had to rely on word-of-mouth and referrals to get customers. But as time went on, and I gained more experience, 
											more and more people started to come to me for help.
										</p>
										<p align="justify">
											It was challenging to balance my full-time job with my freelance work. I was working long hours and 
											sacrificing my weekends to meet clients. However, as I gained more experience and built a network of clients, 
											I was able to balance my hours at my full-time job and without losing focus on my freelance work.
										</p>
										<p align="justify">
											One of the biggest challenges I faced as a freelance technician was setting clear expectations with clients. 
											It was important to communicate project scope, fees, and deadlines upfront to avoid any misunderstandings. 
											I learned the importance of having a detailed contract and setting boundaries with clients to ensure that 
											I was able to deliver high-quality work while also maintaining a healthy work-life balance.
										</p>
										<p align="justify">
											As my business grew, I faced new challenges such as managing multiple projects at once and dealing with difficult 
											clients. However, I remained committed to delivering quality work and building strong relationships with my clients.
										</p>
										<p align="justify">
											I was able to offer a much-needed service during a difficult time and make some money in the process. 
											It was hard work, but it was worth it. I'm proud to say that my computer repair shop is still going strong after all these years.
										</p>
										<p align="justify">
											Looking back on my journey as a freelance technician, I am grateful for the opportunities it has afforded me. I have been able to work on projects that truly interest me, set my own schedule, 
											and build a network of clients who appreciate my skills and expertise. While there have been challenges along the way, I wouldn't trade my experience for anything.
